# Git Task: Version Control & Merge Conflict Resolution

## Repository Setup
- Initialized a Git repository with `git init`.
- Created two branches: `main` and `feature-branch`.

## Simulating a Conflict
1. Added a line to `file.txt` in the `main` branch and committed.
2. Added a conflicting line to `file.txt` in the `feature-branch` and committed.

## Handling the Conflict
- Attempted to merge `feature-branch` into `main`, triggering a conflict.
- Resolved the conflict manually by editing the file.
- Staged and committed the resolved file.
- Verified the commit history and successful merge.

## Final Status
- Conflict resolved.
- Clean working directory.
- Merged branches: `main`, `feature-branch`.
